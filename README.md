- windows 64 build includes maptool

- focussed on OSM only
- a node and a segment can be driven more than once to allow P-turns and such
- the path building/updating became direction aware
- contains no-HOV for North-America
- applies a penalty for (really)sharp turns
- can work with both Dijkstra and A_star, but A_star is not preferred at present
